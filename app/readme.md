## Website Goal

    The goal of Make Waves was to build a modern, responsive web app for a professional recording studio. The aim was to create something that looks polished and creative while still being easy to use. The site had to work well on all screen sizes, reflect the branding of a forward-thinking studio, and offer real features â€” like user login, session bookings, and an admin dashboard. Overall, I wanted the site to feel like a real tool a studio could actually use.
